# Prior Calculation

This project focuses on the implementation of a prior function used in clustering analysis. The function calculates the prior distribution parameters necessary for Bayesian mixture modeling.

## Usage

### Requirements

#### R
Ensure you have the following packages installed in R:
- `flowClust`

### How to Run

To use the `prior` function, open the `R/prior_calculation.R` file in your R environment and source it.

### Code Explanation

#### R Code

The R script `prior_calculation.R` defines a `prior` function that calculates the prior distribution parameters used in Bayesian mixture modeling.

#### Python
Ensure you have the following packages installed in Python:
- `numpy`

### How to Run

To use the `prior` function, open the `Python/prior_calculation.py` file and execute it in your Python environment.

### Code Explanation

#### Python Code

The Python script `prior_calculation.py` defines a `prior` function that calculates the prior distribution parameters used in Bayesian mixture modeling.
